# M1 - Inception

## Project Overview

Creating a _software to manage coffee breaks in events_.

### Context

[AETTUA](https://www.aettua.pt/) is a non-profit organization associated with [DETI](https://www.ua.pt/pt/deti/) â€“ University of Aveiro, dedicated to organizing events that foster networking and learning opportunities. They identified the need for a modular web-based event and conference management system to enhance their activities. This system aims to streamline event management processes, improve attendee engagement, and provide a customizable platform for various types of events.

As a Tech Partner of [TEDxAveiro](https://www.tedxaveiro.com/), AETTUA plans to test the new application during the event. This collaboration provides a real-world scenario to validate the system's effectiveness and gather valuable feedback for further improvements.

### Problem

Currently, AETTUA relies on manual methods for managing events, such as using Google Forms for workshop registrations. These methods are time-consuming and prone to errors, making it difficult to efficiently manage events and provide a seamless experience for attendees.

From this, the following problems arose:
- **Lack of a modular design**: The current system is not flexible enough to adapt to different event types, making it difficult to cater to diverse requirements.
- **Rigid pricing structure**: The existing pricing model does not accommodate varying budget requirements across events, limiting accessibility for smaller events.
- **Limited aesthetic customization options**: Event organizers do not have total freedom to build the event's image, restricting the ability to create a unique and engaging experience.
- **Inflexible integration of new modules**: The system does not easily support the addition of new modules to meet specific requirements that may arise in particular events, hindering scalability and adaptability.
- **Lack of scalability**: Managing multiple events simultaneously becomes challenging without proper tools. While handling a single event might be manageable, organizing two or three events, or only a big one, in the same month can overwhelm the current system, leading to delays and errors.

Addressing these problems is crucial for developing a more effective event management system that can meet the diverse needs of different events and provide a better experience for both organizers and attendees.

### High-Level Architecture
![High Level Architecture](../assets/img/HighLevelArchitecture.png)
We have designed a high-level plguin-oriented architecture to outline the potential interactions within the system. This architecture will likely evolve as the project progresses. As shown in the image, the system consists of a core, which provides the essential functionality needed for it to operate. On top of this core, organizers will have the flexibility to enable or disable plugins based on their specific needs.
