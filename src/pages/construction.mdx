This updated diagram imploved the data flows and made some interactions clearer and easier to understand.
## Repository Division

As reflected in our project architecture, the **CoffeeBreak** platform adopts a plugin-oriented design, emphasizing modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Thus, our repository division closely mirrors this architectural approach, clearly distinguishing between core services, frontend interfaces, and dynamically integrated plugins.

### Core Repositories

The project consists primarily of three fundamental repositories:

#### [`core`](https://github.com/PI-coffeeBreak/core)
The core repository contains the foundational backend functionalities required by the system, such as:
- RESTful APIs (FastAPI)
- User authentication and authorization (Keycloak)
- Database integrations (PostgreSQL and MongoDB)
- Core business logic
- Plugin management and orchestration
- Activities and users management

#### [`frontend`](https://github.com/PI-coffeeBreak/frontend)
The frontend repository provides the web interface tailored for event organizers and staff. Its key features include:
- Event creation and editing capabilities
- The ability to create and manage custom pages with components
- Authentication via Keycloak

#### [`event-app`](https://github.com/PI-coffeeBreak/event-app)
A Progressive Web App (PWA) dedicated to end-users attending events, offering functionalities like:
- Viewing event activities
- Real-time notifications
- Can have other functionalities depending on the plugins used

### Plugin Repositories

These repositories encapsulate individual plugins, each providing specific functionalities:

#### [`event-schedule-plugin`](https://github.com/PI-coffeeBreak/event-schedule-plugin)
Manages and displays event schedules to attendees.

#### [`registration-system-plugin`](https://github.com/PI-coffeeBreak/registration-system-plugin)
Handles attendee registration and related processes.

#### [`sponsors-promotion-plugin`](https://github.com/PI-coffeeBreak/sponsors-promotion-plugin)
Allows management and promotion of event sponsors.

#### [`speaker-presentation-plugin`](https://github.com/PI-coffeeBreak/plugin-speaker)
Manages profiles and information about event speakers.

#### [`floor-plan-plugin`](https://github.com/PI-coffeeBreak/plugin-floorplan)
Facilitates visualization and management of event floor plans or venue layouts.

#### [`activities-feedback-plugin`](https://github.com/PI-coffeeBreak/plugin-feedback)
Collects attendee feedback through ratings and descriptions.

### Notifications and Alerts

Plugins and services related to notifications:

#### [`webpush-notifications-plugin`](https://github.com/PI-coffeeBreak/webpush-notifications-plugin)
Wrapper providing simplified integration of web push notifications.

#### [`webpush-sender`](https://github.com/PI-coffeeBreak/webpush-sender)
Dedicated service responsible for dispatching web push notifications using RabbitMQ and Node.js.

#### [`alert-system-plugin`](https://github.com/PI-coffeeBreak/alert-system-plugin)
Supports the creation and management of user alerts and notifications.

### Others

Additional repositories supporting infrastructure, documentation, and reporting:

#### [`orchestrator`](https://github.com/PI-coffeeBreak/orchestrator)
Facilitates the deployment of the entire ecosystem through container orchestration.

#### [`api-application-deployment`](https://github.com/PI-coffeeBreak/api-application-deployment)
Bundles all necessary modules for streamlined deployment.

#### [`pi-coffeebreak.github.io`](https://github.com/PI-coffeeBreak/pi-coffeebreak.github.io)
Mini-website containing all project-related information and documentation.

#### [`diagrams`](https://github.com/PI-coffeeBreak/diagrams)

### Advantages of Plugin-Oriented Repository Division

- **Scalability**: Allows independent scaling and deployment of individual plugins.
- **Maintainability**: Facilitates simpler, targeted updates and bug fixes.
- **Flexibility**: Easily add or remove features without affecting core functionalities.
- **Collaboration**: Encourages parallel development by distributed teams.

This modular structure provides clear delineation of responsibilities, simplifies maintenance, and significantly enhances the extensibility of the **CoffeeBreak** ecosystem.
