## Usability Tests

#### Methodology
- Conducted with 10 participants from different backgrounds
- Each session lasted approximately 20 minutes
- Participants were asked to complete specific tasks
- Tests were performed on both desktop and mobile devices

#### Most Important Feedback
- Feedback availability should appear a few minutes before the event finishes
- It wasn't evident how to install the PWA, so we added a button


#### Test Results
Number of participants: 16
- Range of ages: 18-41
- 40% male and 60% female

Average SUS Score: 74%

#### Implemented Improvements
- Interface modifications
- Developed a step-by-step guide for administrators
- Optimized overall responsiveness

## Production 

Our project went to production at the TEDxAveiro event on the 24th of May and at the students@DETI event on the 28th of May. 

#### Deployment Details
- The application is deployed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), making it easily accessible on both desktop and mobile devices
- Users can install the app directly from their browsers for offline access
- The backend is hosted on a secure cloud infrastructure ensuring reliable performance during events

#### Real-World Usage
- Successfully managed multiple events with hundreds of participants
- Real-time synchronization ensured smooth coordination between participants and organizers
- The feedback system provided valuable insights for event improvement
- The PWA approach eliminated the need for app store submissions and simplified distribution
